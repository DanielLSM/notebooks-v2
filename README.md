# notebooks-v2
My second version of notebooks. 
This notebook contains random code and random thoughts. To be used just like a random art notebook.

My first version was very naive and had simple examples. This one is more structured and focused on ML, RL and DL. Most scripts will be in python using tensorflow.

This serves mostly as training and to test ideas of papers and somewhat.
